# AQI-City-Classification-KNN

This repository contains a Python project that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, implemented with Scikit-learn, to classify cities as "acceptable" or "dangerous" based on Air Quality Index (AQI) data for a particular day.

## Project Overview

Air Quality Index (AQI) is a crucial indicator of air pollution levels, affecting public health. This project aims to classify cities into two categories: "acceptable" (safe) and "dangerous" (unsafe) based on the AQI data of a particular day. The classification is done using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes AQI values and other relevant pollutant concentrations for various cities. Each city is labeled as "acceptable" or "dangerous" based on predetermined thresholds.
